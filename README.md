## Instructions

`node HelloWorld.js`  


**HelloWorld**  

Just run with:  

`node hello.js`  


**HelloWorldInit**  

Run with:  

`node hello.js`  

But note that package.json was created by running an:   
`npm init`

The launch.json file is included in /.vscode.  You can use that as a starting point for a debugging configuratiion in VS Code.  Set a breakpoint on line 2 of the code, and launch using the debugger in VS Code.
